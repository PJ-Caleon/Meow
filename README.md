## 🌷 **Introduction**  
This project is still a work in progress, and contributions to improve the code are highly appreciated!  

The app displays a list of cat names in a **checkbox format**. When a checkbox is selected, the cat’s name appears in a text box below. A button allows users to **copy the list to their clipboard**, making it easy to paste into the main group chat—no need to type names manually! (Very kewl, yah~ 🍬)

## 🌟 **Why Use Meow? (Pros)**  
- 🌸 **Time-Saving:** Trainers can log attendance quickly without manually typing each cat’s name.  
- 🌼 **Easy to Remember:** The checklist helps trainers recall cat names, even if they haven’t trained in a while.  
- 🦋 **Special Diets Included:** Each cat’s dietary needs are listed next to their name, ensuring proper feeding.  
- 🌈 **Aesthetic & Functional:** It’s not just useful—it’s **cute**! 🐾  

---

## 🌧️ **Things to Consider (Cons)**  
Honesty is key! Here are some current limitations:  
- 🌪️ **App History Matters:** The app should not be removed from history, or the checkbox selections will reset. This is **important** for tracking which cats have eaten!  
- 😔 **Android-Only:** Unfortunately, this app **only works on Android** (I’m not the best programmer, okay? 😭).

## 🎀 **Future Improvements (Contributions Welcome!)**  
If you’re good at programming, I’d love your help making this app better:  
1. 🐾 **Cross-Platform Support:** Make the app available for **Apple users**.  
2. 🌟 **Easier Installation:** Publish it on the **Google Play Store** or provide a smoother download method.  
3. 🐢 **Want to help?** Send me a DM, and I’ll add you to the project’s collaborators!
