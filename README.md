# 💚✨ **Meow** ✨💚  

Welcome to **Meow**! 🌟 This is a cat attendance tracker used by trainers to take note of the DLSU cat's attendance! 🐾✨

## 🌷 **Introduction**  
This project is a work in progress and help to make the code better would be appreceated. This program displays all the name of the cats in a checkbox manner. Selecting the checkbox will display its name at a textbox below the application. Selecting the "Copy n' Clear" button will copy the text to your phone, allowing the trainer to paste the cat list to the main GC without the need for typing the cats individually. (Very kewl yah~) 🍬

## 🌟 **Pros**   
- 🌸 **Time Efficient:** Allowing the trainer to focus on other matters without the need for typing the cats name all the time.  
- 🌼 **Easy to Remember:** Having a list of all the cat names makes it easier for the trainer to remember their names even if they haven't trained for a long time.  
- 🦋 **Special Diets:** Aside from the name placed on the checkbox, their diets is also listed beside it allowing the trainer to know their special diet without trying to remember or do excessive experiments.   
- 🌈 **Aesthetic:** It's not just functional, it's cute! 🐾

## 🌧️ **Cons**  
Honesty is key! Here are a few areas to watch out for:  
- 🍂 The code right now is not efficient! Whenever there needs to be edits such as adding, removing, re-editing the list. The user must go through the code itself to edit the lines. 
- 🌪️ The trainer should not remove the app from the history list, otherwise the checkbox will be reset! This is very important when keeping track of cats that have eaten or not.  
- 😔 This application only works on android. I am not the best programmer : (
